## Modelling GNUTELLA-like P2P File Transfer Networks
This project provides a modelling framework for resilient GNUTELLA-like peer-to-peer (P2P) file transfer and distribution networks. It models network behavior, agent interactions using Gossip messaging, and fault tolerance mechanisms to study the features of P2P as a complex system.

### Features
- Graph Generation - creates initial overlay Network.
- Simulates P2P network topologies and client roles
    Seeder | Leecher | Hybrid
- Models node failures and recovery
- Node/Agent Routing of Query/QueryHit
- Analyses data distribution efficiency and emergent features

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jbwod/COMP4403-Project.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the framework with the included Jupyter Notebook.
4. Generate a Graph with desired parameters.
