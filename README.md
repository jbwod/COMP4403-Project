## Simulating and Modelling Resilient P2Peer Transfer & Distribution Networks
This project provides a simulation framework for resilient peer-to-peer (P2P) file transfer and distribution networks. It models network behavior, node interactions, and fault tolerance mechanisms to study the robustness of P2P systems.

### Features

- Simulates P2P network topologies and client roles
- Models node failures and recovery
- Analyses data distribution efficiency and emergent features

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jbwod/COMP4403-Project.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the simulation.
